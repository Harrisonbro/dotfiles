# dotfiles

This is a collection of scripts, hacks and reminders about how I set up my environment on my Mac. Folders correspond to folders on the Mac, relative to system root (ie. /)

## Scripts to run
- <code>ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" ~/bin/subl</code>  
  This adds subl to ~/bin which is my terminal path, allowing use of Sublime Text 2 from the terminal
